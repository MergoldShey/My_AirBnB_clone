# AirBnB clone - The console
Group project
 - The console is the interactive part of the AirBnB clone website where we
    - create the object
    - create the BaseModel to take care of the initialization, serialization and deserilization
    - create all classes used for AirBnB 
    - create the first abstract storage engine of the project
    - create all unittests to validate all our classes and storage engine
 - Command line interpreter does the exaact same thing as the Shell but with limited use-case. In our case we use it to 
    - create a new object 
    - retrieve an object from a file, a database etc
    - do operations on object
    - update attributes of an object
    - destroy them
